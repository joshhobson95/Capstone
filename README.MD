# Shiny Pokemon Checklist
## Overview
The Shiny Pokemon Checklist is an intuituve and easy way to track a pokemon player's shiny pokemon collection. Using its own JSON database, the app simulates a server and a database in order to run the application on your machine locally. The Shiny Pokemon Checklist will keep track of which pokemon you have found shiny as well as a running tally of each you have obtained. Simply hit the add button to add a pokemon to the list and the app will colorize each pokemon having a quantity of one or more. You can also add pokemon to the JSON database with the form at the top of the page to expand the database and include any unlisted pokemon to your collection. Lastly, if you cannot decide which shiny pokemon you should hunt next, the random button at the top right of the screen will alert the user with a message containing a random pokemon from the list.
